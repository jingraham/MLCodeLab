# Intro to Machine Learning Labs

## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
Lab 1 can be found at `lab1`.

First, we'll walk through `lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb` together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through `lab1/news_group_exercise.ipynb` yourself.

We provide a sample solution in `lab1/sample_news_group_solution.ipynb`.

## Lab 2: Intro to DNN Packages: PyTorch
Lab 2 can be found at `lab2`.

First, we'll walk through `lab2/mnist_tutorial.ipynb` together, and cover how to build and tune models on PyTorch. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through `lab2/cifar_exercise.ipynb` yourself. 

We provide a sample solution in `lab2/cifar_sample_solution.ipynb`.


## Running the labs
The labs are Google Colaboratory notebooks, so just click the `View in Colaboratory` link on the notebook, and you should be all set!
To save your progress, you can copy the notebooks to your own google drive.
